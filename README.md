# TravelExperts5

Construct this page to enable the form data to be sent to an ASP.NET page that will verify the data and either re-display the form with appropriate error messages, or create a customer record.

Validations that are required:
-verify that all required fields have been filled-in – business phone and email are optional since many of our customers are seniors who are retired and may not use email (one question you may want to ask the Travel Experts managers is whether it is likely that customers with the Internet skills to use a web browser to set up an account would not have an email address)
-check that the postal code has the correct format – we are not concerned about U.S. zip codes at present, but if you want to demonstrate how that could be done, please build it.
-ensure that the phone number is composed of numeric digits and has an area code
-ensure that the password has been entered twice and the entries are equal

Enhance the customer sign-up page to enable customers to log in and update their data.  This will require the use of the user-id and password that you added to the customer table.

Design a page that will enable a customer to list the travel products they have purchased, and get a price breakdown listing the cost of each product or package, and the total cost owing.

Write an informal reflective journal of around half a page that discusses what you learned from the modules during this term, how your team-members worked together 
(were there communication/scheduling/etc. issues that had to be resolved?), what things worked best, and what you would do differently in the future.
 Don’t mention any names, just think about the processes your team used, how well they worked and how they could be improved for your next project.  
This should be in a Word/OpenOffice/RTF document which will be added to the zip file that you hand in with your second presentation.

Reflective Journal

Learnings from the modules this term:
Using ASP.NET web forms and how it compares to ASP.NET MVC design pattern.	
In ASP.NET MVC pattern, the complete separation of view,data and business logic allows the design, implementation and testing of each portion of the application while keeping the code organized.
Although MVC is faster in the application development process, our team decided to go with ASP.NET web forms as we felt that we were more in control and 
there are less auto-generated code.

Group Work:
Our team has a good chemistry because of our complementary talents. 
The team had a clear understanding of what the goal was and supported each other.

Realizations:
Initially our team decided to use github, but with the lack of experience with the software, we easily encountered issues in code integration. 
The team overcame this by setting a masterfile in one machine and, updating that file/code daily by copying and pasting code manually.
This would be a great area for improvement and will be something we should practice and learn before the next workshop.
